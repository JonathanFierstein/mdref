# mdref
As I was learning how to use Git and Github, I was frustrated by the lack of a reference 
for GitHub flavored Markdown that was complete, accurate, and had multiple examples for
functions that were complex or where it was impossible to demonstrate all of the 
functionality in a single example.  mdref was born of a desire for such a reference
and a need to build a first repository that actually had a useful purpose.

## Methods

Each section will contain a small blerb describing the functionality that section will 
demonstrate.  Next each section will contain a series of examples.   Each example will 
beign with a short description of the specific functionality being demonstrated followed 
by the example and any syntactic explanation that is neccessary.  Finally,  raw and 
mardown intrepreted versions of the example will be shown.


##### Example:

```
Text can easily be emphasized using **bold** or *italic* sections of text.
More complicated fuctions like links are still easy like this link to
[GitHub's Mastering Markdown page](http://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Headings

The first section will demonstrate headings.   Markdown makes it very simple
to designate a section of text as a heading.   A # at the beginning of a line indicates
the largest heading size.   As you increase #s, all the way up to 6 ######, the heading
gets smaller and smaller but retains the heading status.

##### Headings Example:

```
# Top Headings <h1> Tag
## 1st Mid-Level Headings <h2> Tag
### 2nd Mid-Level Heading <h3> Tag
#### 3rd Mid-Level Heading <h4> Tag
###### Small Heading <h6> Tag
```

# Top Headings <h1> Tag
## 1st Mid-Level Headings <h2> Tag
### 2nd Mid-Level Heading <h3> Tag
#### 3rd Mid-Level Heading <h4> Tag
###### Small Heading <h6> Tag




## Quotes

Quotes are really simple.   All you need to do is place a > before each line
that you are quoting.   

##### Quotes Example:

```
>Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document;
>formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few 
>of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a 
>few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
