# mdref
As I was learning how to use Git and Github, I was frustrated by the lack of a reference 
for GitHub flavored Markdown that was complete, accurate, and had multiple examples for
functions that were complex or where it was impossible to demonstrate all of the 
functionality in a single example.  mdref was born of a desire for such a reference
and a need to build a first repository that actually had a useful purpose.

## Methods

Each section will contain a small blerb describing the functionality that section will 
demonstrate.  Next each section will contain a series of examples.   Each example will 
beign with a short description of the specific functionality being demonstrated followed 
by the example and any syntactic explanation that is neccessary.  Finally,  raw and 
mardown intrepreted versions of the example will be shown.


## Headings

The first section will demonstrate headings.   Markdown allows text to be shown as a heading
of several different sizes quite easily.

# Top Headings
## Mid-Level Headings
### Minor Heading
